        >For each lift, I have created documentation that will help any lifter
        to overcome plateaus. This documentation mainly focuses on 6 different
        areas and the corresponding exercises to help in those areas. These 6
        areas are the beginning of each lift, the middle of each lift, and the
        end of each lift as well as exercises that help strengthen the movement
        of each lift, exercises that help the speed of each lift, and exercises
        that add general carryover to each lift. Some exercises can benefit
        multiple areas, meanwhile others are focused on one area. I've provided
        color-coded documentation to help you sift through what you need.</p3
